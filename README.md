# Currency-Converter-USD-to-CAD-AUD-
This currency converter uses an API to import live rates for CAD &amp; AUD and will convert your USD.

Go down to FreeCurrencyAPI and get yourself a free key. Once you have a key all you need to do is plug it in to the top of the program under client, allow permissions to import the system for the API, download the reader, follow the onscreen instructions, and you are good to go. 

Use this to download the API through the terminal: "pip install freecurrencyapi python-dotenv".

Enjoy!
